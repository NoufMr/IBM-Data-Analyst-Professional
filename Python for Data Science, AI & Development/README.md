# Python for Data Science, AI & Development
## About this Course
This introduction to Python course will take from zero to programming in Python in a matter of hoursâ€”no prior programming experience necessary! Learn about Python basics and the different data types. Familiarize yourself with Python Data structures like List and Tuples, as well as logic concepts like conditions and branching. Use Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy & Beautiful Soup.Use Python to perform tasks such as data collection and web scraping with APIs.  

Practiced and applied what learned through hands-on labs using Jupyter Notebooks.
